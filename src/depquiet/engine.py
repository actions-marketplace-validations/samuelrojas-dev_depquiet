"""Scan engine — orchestrates parsers, filters, and triage verdicts.

The engine is the core of depquiet. It:
1. Detects the package manager
2. Runs the appropriate scanner
3. Applies all filters in order
4. Assigns a verdict to each vulnerability
5. Returns a ScanResult with the full triage

Filter order matters for the output (we show the FIRST reason that matched),
but not for correctness — a vulnerability is filtered if ANY filter matches.
